#Bay_Wheels

Bay Wheels is a a visual investigation of ridershare usage among Lyft's bicycle renters (Free Wheels) within the San Francisco Bay Area for the year 2018. The data can be found at: https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html

 Here I use the R shiny app to create a story board that depicts descriptive statistics about the riders and favorite destinations to which they ride.

There are three four files in this repository:

1. data: a folder containing all of the required Lyft Bay Wheels data

2. BayWHeels_2018.Rproj: the R project needed to link data and code- open first!

3. Najarro_Michael_Baywheels.Rmd: Rmakrdown file containing the code to build the storyboard

4. Najarro_Michael_Baywheels.html: the end result
